# üìä Data Analytics & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights a curated collection of **data science, analytics, and applied machine learning projects** I‚Äôve completed through **government research, academic programs, and full-stack development initiatives**.

Each project demonstrates my ability to combine **data engineering, statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud-ready software development** to deliver **actionable insights, automation, and decision support**.

Deliverables include **Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown reports, interactive Tableau dashboards, and deployed applications**.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

* **Smart City Infrastructure (NCHRP 01-57B)**
  Contributed to a **federally funded research project** supporting the Federal Highway Administration and State DOTs. Developed an interpretable JPCP slab classification method with **86.2% accuracy**, comparable to deep learning but transparent for policy adoption. Findings were incorporated into a **national pavement condition framework**.

* **Receipt Fraud Detection**
  Built a **multimodal fraud-detection system** combining OCR, image features, and anomaly detection. Reduced false positives while improving precision in detecting forged receipts ‚Äî strengthening compliance in financial reporting.

* **Receipt Tracking App (In Development)**
  Designed and deployed an OCR-based full-stack web app for automated expense management. Achieved **90%+ field-level accuracy** (merchant, total, date) on U.S. receipt test data. Delivered full lifecycle: **FastAPI backend, ML pipeline, Firebase, Next.js frontend, and cloud deployment (Render + Vercel)**.

## üîé Data Analysis & Visualization

* **[Bike Share Program Analysis](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/bike_share_program_analysis.Rmd)**
  Analyzed **200k+ ride records** from Cyclistic‚Äôs 2021 dataset to identify behavioral differences between casual riders and members, surfacing **membership conversion opportunities**.
  *Tools: R Markdown*

* **[Chicago Crime Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/trinh.flynt/viz/ChicagoCrime2015-2019/Story2)**
  Evaluated crime patterns (2015‚Äì2019) to reveal **urban safety trends** influencing Chicago‚Äôs development.
  *Tools: KNIME, Tableau*

* **[Customer Demographics Analysis](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/customer_demographics_analysis_KNIME.pdf)**
  Profiled Pennsylvania households using U.S. Census ACS data, producing **housing market segmentation insights** for mortgage and loan targeting.
  *Tools: KNIME*
