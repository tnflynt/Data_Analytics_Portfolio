## üîé Data Analysis & Visualization  

- **[Bike Share Program Analysis](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/bike_share_program_analysis.Rmd)**  
  Explores Cyclistic‚Äôs 2021 dataset to understand differences between annual members and casual riders. Identifies behavioral factors that could increase membership conversion.  
  *Tools: R Markdown*  

- **[Chicago Crime Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/trinh.flynt/viz/ChicagoCrime2015-2019/Story2)**  
  Analyzes crime patterns in Chicago (2015‚Äì2019) to evaluate safety trends relevant to urban development.  
  *Tools: KNIME, Tableau*  

- **[Customer Demographics Analysis](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/customer_demographics_analysis_KNIME.pdf)**

## ü§ñ Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling  

- **Smart City Infrastructure ‚Äì NCHRP 01-57B (Aug 2024 ‚Äì May 2025)**  
  *Validating proposed definitions for comparable pavement cracking data*  

  - **Objective**: Support the Federal Highway Administration and State DOTs in validating and refining standardized definitions for automated pavement cracking measurement (asphalt and JPCP).  
  - **My Contribution**:  
    - **Aug 2024 ‚Äì Feb 2025**: Conducted **statistical case study analyses** to validate revised cracking definitions (WOD-288). Performed sensitivity studies on grid size, crack width thresholds, and orientation to assess robustness of the standard.  
    - **Mar 2025 ‚Äì May 2025**: Developed a **new interpretable classification method** for Jointed Plain Concrete Pavement (JPCP) slab states using geometric features and tree-based models, improving interpretability compared to prior deep learning approaches.  
    - Co-authored the **Task 8 Data Analysis report**, synthesizing methodology, findings, and refinements for submission to the DOT research panel.  
  - **Software/Tools**: Python, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV
  - **Deliverables**: [Task 8 Data Analysis Report (PDF)](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/20250317-Task%208%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)  

- **[Credit Card Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/credit_card_customer_segmentation.ipynb)**  
  Built clustering models (K-Means, autoencoders) to segment customers by spending behavior. Generated recommendations for segment-specific engagement.  
  *Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn*  

- **[Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/boston_house_price_prediction.ipynb)**  
  Developed regression models to predict housing prices.  
  *Tools: PySpark on Google Colab*  

- **[Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/tnflynt/Data_Analytics_Portfolio/blob/main/heart_disease_prediction.ipynb)**  
  Logistic regression model predicting likelihood of heart disease using clinical data.  
  *Tools: PySpark on Google Colab*
